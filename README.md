# How I Setup my Development Computer

### Computer Choice
I use a Mac computer, because it is the (only) choice. Yes, Linux is an option too. Microsoft is not an option. I think Apple is better because:

1. Apple computers are typically more powerful than generic computers, especially if you get an ARM-based system (although Linux is lightweight and gives great performance for the given hardware)
2. It has almost all of the Linux functions, plus more. Microsoft is clunky.
3. There is a lot--A LOT--of sofware that is written only for POSIX systems, and with Windows you are either SOL or you have to do a workaround.
4. Most sample code and helps are written for either Mac or Linux (and Mac can typically run Linux commands, either directly or with tweaks to the code). With Microsoft, you are left to interpret and recode.
5. You really need to use a Unix-like file system and be able to run Unix-like shells
6. The Mac ecosystem. Outside of coding, your mac integrates with your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, Apple TV, HomeKit, etc., and you can share your purchased apps and Apple+ with your family, and you can track your kids etc etc.

Plus, some additional considerations:

7. It is cooler
8. You will look like a real programmer at the cafe or the workspace

If you are forced to use a Microsoft computer at work, then fine, but install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and use that.
Props to Linux users. A great option too. But I like Mac. To each his own. We can jointly hate on Microsoft.

### Desktop
I am using an iMac, but in the future I will be using a Mac Book Pro with a dock and widescreen monitor. I purchased a version with basic RAM, and then replaced it with aftermarket RAM, since it is so much cheaper than buying it from Apple. In future versions that have glued or soldered RAM, this won't be possible. In that case, I will buy as much RAM as I can afford, because I think it is so important.

I am not using a computer dock since I don't have a laptop, but I would choose one that has the power to connect to multiple monitors using Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt is better and faster than HDMI, and can send data both ways.

The iMac has a built-in monitor (which is of good quality), so I don't have a separate monitor. In the future I will get a widescreen monitor, with another monitor in landscape mode to display my email program, slack, or code.

For a keyboard, I am using the [MacTigr](https://www.daskeyboard.com/mactigr/) from Das Keyboards. It is a mechanical keyboard designed with a Mac layout. Das also offers [Dvorak keycaps](https://shop.daskeyboard.com/collections/accessories/products/das-keyboard-modern-font-dvorak-rgb-keycap-set-for-gamma-zulu-switches-translucent), if that is your typing orientation. The only gripe I have is that I wish this keyboard had backlighting. Other Das keyboards do have backlighting, but not the MacTigr. Finally, I pair this with the [Palm Rest One](https://shop.daskeyboard.com/collections/accessories/products/das-keyboard-palm-rest-one), which I think is a necessity.

For a mouse, I use the Logitech [MX Master 3 for Mac](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s-mac-bluetooth-mouse) mouse. It also needs a good mousepad. I prefer hard plastic. For this, I use the Logitech-G [G440 Gaming Mousepad](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mouse-pads/g440-hard-gaming-mouse-pad.943-000790.html). Previously, I used the SteelSeries [QCK Hard Pad](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-hard), which was also really good, and I might return to again. Both are about equal in my opinion.

For headphones, I use the Bose [QuietComfort](https://www.bose.com/p/headphones/quietcomfort-acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones/QC-HEADPHONEARN.html?dwvar_QC-HEADPHONEARN_color=WHITE%20SMOKE) headphones (formerly QuietComfort 45), although Bose recently came out with the [QuietComfort Ultra](https://www.bose.com/p/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones/QCUH-HEADPHONEARN.html?dwvar_QCUH-HEADPHONEARN_color=WHITE%20SMOKE&quantity=1). I am intrigued by the Das [Holosonic T1w](https://www.daskeyboard.com/holosonic-t1w/) headphones, which are much cheaper and also connect over wifi in addition to bluetooth.

I use a generic [bookstand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MVBDLFC) that I bought on Amazon. There are plenty of other options.

A light is important to illuminate your workspace. BenQ [Blue Genie LED Desk Lamp](https://www.amazon.com/BenQ-Monitors-Eye-Ergonomic-White-Perfect-Architects/dp/B06Y1WN1VJ/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1D9YHUF5NVUOX&keywords=benq%2BLED&qid=1702757296&s=office-products&sprefix=benq%2Bled%2Coffice-products%2C130&sr=1-5&th=1) is a good choice. Although it is offered still on Amazon, BenQ apparently doesn't make it anymore. BenQ also offers the [e-Reading Desk Lamp](https://www.benq.com/en-us/lighting/e-reading-desk-lamp.html) and a monitor lightbar called the [ScreenBar Halo](https://www.benq.com/en-us/lighting/monitor-light.html), either which might be a good option.

For work, I need to insert a security card in order to access certain websites. For this, I use the [Cherry SmartTerminal ST-1144](https://www.cherryamericas.com/smartterminal-st-1144). It has a hefty weight and sits nicely on my desktop. Another option might be the HID [Omnikey 3121](https://www.hidglobal.com/products/omnikey-3121). Follow the advice [here for USB](https://militarycac.com/usbreaders.htm) and [here for USB-C](https://militarycac.com/usbcreaders.htm). Don't buy any cheap Chinese crap on Amazon, because you never know what [malware](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/05/when-your-smart-id-card-reader-comes-with-malware/comment-page-1/) it contains.

### Travel / Remote Work System

My travel package will include a Mac Book Pro. No purchase yet.

No current recommendations for a travel or remote work bag. My criteria will be that it fits a 15-inch computer snugly; has a separate compartment for documents; has a separate compartment for computer peripherals, or can hold a peripherals bag; has a separate compartment for extraneous items such as pens and keys; and folds open for TSA compliance.

For I keyboard, I plan to use a Logitech-G [Pro X TKL Wireless Keyboard](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-keyboards/pro-x-tkl-wireless-keyboard.html).

For a mouse, I plan to use a Logitech [MX Anywhere 3 for Mac](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-anywhere-3-mac) mouse.

No current recommendations for an accessories bag

For a laptop bar, I plan to use a BenQ [Laptop Bar](https://www.benq.com/en-us/lighting/laptop-light.html).

A great choice for a security card reader is the Identiv [SCR3310v2](https://www.identiv.com/products/logical-access-control/smart-card-readers-writers/contact-smart-card-readers-writers/scr3310v2).


### OS Settings

These are my preferred settings for Finder and the Dock.

### Finder
  - Finder -> Preferences
    - General -> Show these on the desktop -> Select None
      - I try to keep my desktop completely clean.
    - General -> New Finder windows show -> Home Folder
      - I prefer to see my home folder in each new finder window instead of recent documents
    - Advanced -> Show all filename extensions -> Yes
    - Advanced -> Show warning before changing an extension -> No
    - Advanced -> When performing a search -> Search the current folder
  - View
    - Show Status Bar
    - Show Path Bar
    - Show Tab Bar

### Dock






### Browser

For a browser, I use [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com), which I install using Brew. Vivaldi is a Chromium-based browser that offers better security and lots of features. I add several extensions: Save to Pocket for reading articles; daily.dev and hackertab.dev to keep track of developer news; octotree, to see github files in a tree format; github-vscode-icons; among others. I use hackertab.dev as my homepage. Another great option is the [Brave Browser](https://brave.com), another Chromium-based browser that offers excellent security.

In Vivaldi, I use the following workspaces: Personal, Work, Data Science, and Training. In the Personal workspace, I will pin tabs for [GMail](mail.google.com), [Google Calendars](calendar.google.com), my bank, etc. In Work, I pin work email, my timesheet, etc. I stack tabs for various projects or threads.

### Text Editor / IDE

For a Text Editor / IDE, I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It is open source (although owned by Microsoft), is customizable, and has plenty of extensions. It is also the most popular text editor and you will probably see most people using it. Another great option is JetBrains [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), a full-featured IDE, which I install using the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/). If you want a one-stop shop, go with PyCharm. I've used both, and both are great. I am using VS Code due to its popularity and modularity.

VS Code extensions that I use include: [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) (includes

I use both [AWS CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/resources/#Getting_started/), [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/whisper-setup-ide-devs.html), [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/whisper-setup-ide-devs.html), or [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/what-is-cwspr.html), Duet AI (Google) and Codium AI for code completions and artificial intelligence within VS Code. I also install GitHub Copilot, but do not use it as much except as an additional option. Codium is focused more on testing and documentation, so it is complementary to the others Only activate one autocompletion tool at a time. AWS CodeWhisperer is tricky to set up, as you need to activate some settings in AWS Toolkit and create a AWS Builder ID (Developer account, different from an AWS account). Duet AI is also tricky to set up, as you need to activate some settings in Google Cloud Platform. Follow the instructions in the Chrome Store. CodeWhisperer is currently free (tbd).
For CodeWhisperer for terminals such as [iTerm2]().
For CodeWhisperer with [VS Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/whisper-setup-ide-devs.html).
For CodeWhisperer with [PyCharm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/whisper-setup-ide-devs.html).
For CodeWhisperer with [JupyterLab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/jupyterlab-setup.html).
I also would like to try [Fig.io](https://fig.io), an IDE-style autocomplete for your existing terminal. It is now incorporated into [Amazon CodeWisperer for Command Line](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/introducing-amazon-codewhisperer-for-command-line/). It works with only some terminal emulators, to include VS Code, iTerm2, and Alacritty. Doesn't work with Warp. It may have conflicts with other autocompletion script. So, I'm not currently using it, but could in the future. Install CodeWhisperer with brew.

I also install [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) independently.


### Brew
[Brew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager for MacOS and works similar to apt or dnf. I use it to download most software, both command-line and gui apps. The benefit is that you can regularly use ```brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup``` to update all apps you downloaded with brew.

### Terminal Emulator & Shell
For a terminal emulator, I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com).. It is a very customizable and fast terminal (Mac only). install with Brew. Install new color themes [here](https://iterm2colorschemes.com) (try Gruvbox Dark). I also like [Warp](https://www.warp.dev), which is very fast (written in Rust) and has plenty of features (Mac only). Install with Brew. If I needed a cross-platform terminal, I would use Alacritty. It is hyper-customizable, and uses a .toml file for customizations. Install with brew.

I use [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) as my shell. Mac has zsh as its default shell, but I like to download the most up-to-date version using brew. After installing, use the command ```chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh``` to activate this new shell. Also update this in VS Code settings.json.

I also use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/clvv/oh-my-zsh) as a configuration framework for zsh. 

I like to use a theme for oh-my-zsh called [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), (also [here](https://fig.io/plugins/other/powerlevel10k)). First, you need to install the [Meslo Nerd Font patched for Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/font.md) (or [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)) by downloading the versions (Normal, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic) and then double-clicking each one to install into your font book. Then follow the instructions for installing Powerlevel10k.

### Fonts, Ligatures, and Autocompletion

For fonts, I like Meslo Nerd Font (patched for Powerlevel10k with the [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) or [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts), described above). Download all Nerd Fonts with this curl script: '''cd ~/Library/Fonts && curl -fLO <https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/HEAD/patched-fonts/DroidSansMono/DroidSansMNerdFont-Regular.otf>
''' I hear another good one, for ligatures, is [Fira](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) (although it doesn't have the patch for Nerd Fonts).

To install Nerd Fonts with any preferred font, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher). You need to download the font you want, then run the [font-patcher script](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher). Install it into your font book by double-clicking on each version (Normal, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic).

To install Ligatures with any preferred font, I tried to follow [these instructions](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer), but had a lot of issues (specifically with regards to the output location). I then tried to use [these instructions](<https://github.com/lemeb/a-better-ligaturizer>), but noticed they already had MesloLGS NF Regular.ttf in the repo, so I just downloaded that. It is supposed to have both Nerd Fonts and Ligatures. I then followed the instructions to install it into my font book by double-clicking on each version (Normal, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic).

Configure the iTerm2 profile to use the font you want. I use MesloLGS Nerd Font. Enable Ligatures.

Do the same for VS Code. Manually editing settings.json, and set "editor.fontLigatures" to true. This will enable ligatures in VS Code.

Finally, [Git](https://git-scm.com) is a must-have. Install with Brew.

### Pyenv
I manage python distributions with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). Pyenv downloads python versions; lets you set the global Python version; lets you set a local (project specific) Python version; lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python; lets you change the global Python version on a per-user basis; Provides support for per-project Python versions; and allows you to override the Python version with an environment variable. It is very useful and better than installing python with brew. Install pyenv with brew.

I add the following plugins for pyenv: pyenv-default-packages, pyenv-doctor, and pyenv-update

### Pipx
[Pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) is used to install Python CLI applications globally while still isolating them in virtual environments. pipx will manage upgrades and uninstalls when used to install Poetry. Install with brew.

I use pipx to install:
black # uncompromising Python code formatter
cookiecutter # creates projects from project templates
flake8 # tool for style guide enforcement
glances # 
jupyter # web-based notebook environment for interactive computing
poetry # python dependency/environment/packaging management
sphinx # 

### Direnv
I like [direnv](https://direnv.net), also [here](https://github.com/direnv/direnv), to load and unload environment variables depending on the current directory. Before each prompt, direnv checks for the existence of a .envrc file in the current and parent directories. If the file exists, it is loaded into a sub-shell and all exported variables are then captured by direnv and then made available to the current shell. It supports hooks for all the common shells like bash, zsh, tcsh and fish. This allows for project-specific environment variables. Install with brew.

### Poetry
I like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for Python packaging and dependency management. Poetry helps you manage your project by creating a virtual environment, resolving dependencies, and then building and packaging your project to a repository when you are done. Poetry creates a pyproject.toml file to manage your project, a README.md file, a .venv virtual environment, and a poetry.lock file. Set the following environment variable in .zshrc or .zshenv: ```POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT=true``` This will tell Poetry to create the virtual environment within the project folder, rather than gathering up all the virtual environments in a centralized Poetry folder. I install Poetry with pipx. For configuration, modify the .config.toml file as follows:

[virtualenvs]<br>
in-project = true # This is actually redundant with the environment variable set above<br>
prefer-active-python = true # Use currently activated Python version to create a new virtual environment. If set to false, Python version used during Poetry installation is used.

### Enable Poetry shell activation and deactivation if you move into a project directory
I couldn't find a pre-packaged solution, but did find [instructions](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/Python) to integrate Poetry into Direnv to accomplish this task. If you enter a directory with a pyproject.toml file, it will automatically activate the virtual environment. If one doesn't exist, it will automatically guide you through the process to create one, and then will create the virtual environment.

Follow the instructions to modify your .direnvrc file, and then also create a .envrc file in the project folder with the following command: '''layout poetry'''.


### Project Folders

Here is how I set up my project folders.

In my home directory, I have a folder called "Dev," which contains all my projects. Within that, I have 00_Project_Template, which as the name implies, is a template that I copy to start a new project. 00_Project_Template has the following folder structure:

02_Sample_Project<br>
├── 00_admin_(charter,scopingDocs)<br>
├── 01_documents_(reference,meetingNotes)<br>
├── 02_inputs # This is where raw data goes; I then copy it to 03_WIP to clean it and analyze<br>
├── 03_WIP # This is where I spend 95% of my time. It includes a subfolder with the coding project,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus all of the other work-in-progress files, such as draft PowerPoint slides or Excel WorkBooks.<br>
└── 04_outputs # Final results go here, such as final presentations or final spreadsheets

Next is 01_Bloat_Project, which contains a virtual environment with all sorts of of packages installed; I use this for quick coding and small projects, just to try stuff out.

For each new project, I increment the number and give it a name in capitalized snake case.

Within the project directory, I use the following folder structure. Everything inside 03_WIP is created below in **Setting Up a Virtual Environment**.

02_Sample_Project<br>
├── 00_admin_(charter,scopingDocs)<br>
├── 01_documents_(reference,meetingNotes)<br>
├── 02_inputs<br>
└── 03_WIP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── sample_project-py<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── .venv<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── src<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── tests<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── .envrc<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── .python-version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── poetry.lock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── pyproject.toml<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── README.md<br>
└── 04_outputs


### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

Copy the 00_Project_Template directory structure and rename it to your project name. Navigate to the 03_WIP folder.<br>

Create your Python project by issuing the ```poetry new test-py``` command (rename test-py to whatever your project name is). This creates a project directory with the following contents: test-py directory; tests directory; pyproject.toml; and README.md.<br>

```cd``` into the project folder and rename the second (nested) project folder to ```src```. Then open the pyproject.toml file and make any modifications you need, such as to the description field.<br>

Add some modules that you know you will need by issuing the ```poetry add numpy pandas requests``` command (edit for your needs). This will write these modules to the pyproject.toml file, create a poetry.lock file, create a virtual environment (.venv) directory, and install the modules.<br>

Issue the ```pyenv local 3.12``` command (substitute the version number for any other version of Python you might want). This creates a ```.python-version``` file.<br>

If you want to create a per-project isolated development environment, create a blank ```.envrc``` file. When you navigate to this directory, **direnv** will recognize it and load the environment variables for that project.<br>

Issue the ```git init``` command to start a git repository.

Your project is setup. If you navigate into the project directory, pyautoenv will automatically activate the virtual environment, and direnv will load the ```.envrc``` file. If you navigate away from the project folder, they will exit and unload.
