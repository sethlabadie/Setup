# How I Setup my Development Computer

### Computer Choice
I use a Mac computer, because it is the (only) choice. Yes, Linux is an option too, but I think Apple is better because:

1. Apple computers are typically more powerful, especially if you get an ARM-based system
2. It has almost all of the Linux functions, plus more
3. Most sample code and helps are written for either Mac or Linux (and Mac can typically run Linux commands, either directly or with tweaks to the code)
4. You really need to use a Unix-like file system and be able to run Unix-like shells

Plus, some additional considerations:

5. It is cooler
6. You will look like a real programmer at the cafe or the workspace

If you are forced to use a Microsoft computer at work, then fine, but install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and use that.

### Desktop
I am using an iMac, but in the future I will be using a Mac Book Pro with a dock and widescreen monitor. I purchased a version with basic RAM, and then replaced it with aftermarket RAM, since it is so much cheaper than buying it from Apple. In future versions that have glued or soldered RAM, this won't be possible. In that case, I will buy as much RAM as I can afford, because I think it is so important.

For a keyboard, I am using the [MacTigr](https://www.daskeyboard.com/mactigr/) from Das Keyboards. It is a mechanical keyboard designed with a Mac layout. Das also offers [Dvorak keycaps](https://shop.daskeyboard.com/collections/accessories/products/das-keyboard-modern-font-dvorak-rgb-keycap-set-for-gamma-zulu-switches-translucent), if that is your typing orientation. The only gripe I have is that I wish this keyboard had backlighting. Other Das keyboards do have backlighting, but not the MacTigr. Finally, I pair this with the [Palm Rest One](https://shop.daskeyboard.com/collections/accessories/products/das-keyboard-palm-rest-one), which I think is a necessity.

For a mouse, I use the Logitech [MX Master 3 for Mac](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s-mac-bluetooth-mouse) mouse.

For headphones, I use the Bose [QuietComfort](https://www.bose.com/p/headphones/quietcomfort-acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones/QC-HEADPHONEARN.html?dwvar_QC-HEADPHONEARN_color=WHITE%20SMOKE) headphones (formerly QuietComfort 45), although Bose recently came out with the [QuietComfort Ultra](https://www.bose.com/p/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones/QCUH-HEADPHONEARN.html?dwvar_QCUH-HEADPHONEARN_color=WHITE%20SMOKE&quantity=1). I am intrigued by the Das [Holosonic T1w](https://www.daskeyboard.com/holosonic-t1w/) headphones, which are much cheaper and also connect over wifi in addition to bluetooth.

I use a generic [bookstand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MVBDLFC) that I bought on Amazon. There are plenty of other options.

A light is important to illuminate your workspace. BenQ [Blue Genie LED Desk Lamp](https://www.amazon.com/BenQ-Monitors-Eye-Ergonomic-White-Perfect-Architects/dp/B06Y1WN1VJ/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1D9YHUF5NVUOX&keywords=benq%2BLED&qid=1702757296&s=office-products&sprefix=benq%2Bled%2Coffice-products%2C130&sr=1-5&th=1) is a good choice. Although it is offered still on Amazon, BenQ apparently doesn't make it anymore. BenQ also offers the [e-Reading Desk Lamp](https://www.benq.com/en-us/lighting/e-reading-desk-lamp.html) and a monitor lightbar called the [ScreenBar Halo](https://www.benq.com/en-us/lighting/monitor-light.html), either which might be a good option.

For work, I need to insert a security card in order to access certain websites. For this, I use the [Cherry SmartTerminal ST-1144](https://www.cherryamericas.com/smartterminal-st-1144). It has a hefty weight and sits nicely on my desktop.
