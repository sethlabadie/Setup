# How I Setup my Development Computer

### Computer Choice
I use a Mac computer, because it is the (only) choice. Yes, Linux is an option too, but I think Apple is better because:

1. Apple computers are typically more powerful, especially if you get an ARM-based system
2. It has almost all of the Linux functions, plus more
3. Most sample code and helps are written for either Mac or Linux (and Mac can typically run Linux commands, either directly or with tweaks to the code)
4. You really need to use a Unix-like file system and be able to run Unix-like shells

Plus, some additional considerations:

5. It is cooler
6. You will look like a real programmer at the cafe or the workspace

If you are forced to use a Microsoft computer at work, then fine, but install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and use that
