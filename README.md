### Computer Setup (Mac, Linux, & Windows)


### Mac Setup
- Make sure you have an Apple ID
- Optional: Download XCode from the Mac App Store. This IDE is primarily for Mac development in Swift, but can be used with other languages, although not ideally.
- Ensure that you're running the most recent operating system. You can check your version by going to "System Preferences" and clicking on "Software Update"
