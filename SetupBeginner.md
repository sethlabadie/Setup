# Beginner Dev Setup

## Computer Choice
I use a Mac computer, because it is the (only) choice. Yes, Linux is an option too. Microsoft is not an option. I think Apple is better because:

1. It basically has all of the Linux goodness, plus all of the Apple goodness. Microsoft has none of the Linux goodness, and none of the Apple goodness. Microsoft is a poor imitation of Apple and is clunky.
2. Apple computers are typically more powerful than generic computers, especially if you get an ARM-based system (although Linux is lightweight and gives great performance for the given hardware).
3. There is a lot--A LOT--of software that is written only for POSIX systems, and with Windows you are either SOL or you have to do a workaround.
4. You really need to use a Unix-like (POSIX) file system and be able to run Unix-like shells
5. Most sample code and helps are written for either Mac or Linux (and Mac can typically run Linux commands, either directly or with tweaks to the code). With Microsoft, you are left to interpret and recode. Go to StackOverflow and see how many questions are written for Windows. Not many.
6. The Mac ecosystem. Outside of coding, your mac integrates with your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, Apple TV, HomeKit, etc., and you can share your purchased apps and Apple+ with your family, and you can track your kids and your dog with an airtag, etc etc.

Plus, some additional considerations:

7. It is cooler
8. You will look like a real programmer at the cafe or the workspace

If you are forced to use a Microsoft computer at work, then fine, but install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux; Ubuntu) and use that. Better yet, run a VirtualBox with Fedora Linux and use that. Best, install Linux on your computer and use that.

Props to Linux users. A great option too. But I like Mac. To each his own. We can jointly hate on Microsoft.

A plus for Mac is that it is more secure. A plus for Mac is that it is more powerful. A plus for Mac is that it is more integrated with the Apple ecosystem. A plus for Mac is that it is more user-friendly. A plus for Mac is that it is more popular. A plus for Mac is that it is more supported. A plus for Mac is that it is more stylish. A plus for Mac is that it is more fun.

A plus for Linux is that it is free. A plus for Linux is that it is efficient, and can breathe new life into old hardware. A plus for Linux is that servers are mostly run on Linux, and so you can develop on Linux and then deploy to Linux. A plus for Linux is that it is more customizable. A plus for Linux is that it is more open-source. A plus for Linux is that it is more lightweight. A plus for Linux is that it is more flexible.

Desktop or laptop is your choice. Either will work. If you are going to be traveling a lot, then a laptop is probably better. If you are going to be working from home, then a desktop is probably better. If you are going to be doing both, then you can get a laptop, with a dock, a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse for your home office.

## Desktop Setup
First piece of advice: pay attention to recommendations in the Intermediate and Advanced Setups if you want to think about getting a system you can grow with
Mac Mini, Mac Studio, Mac Pro, or buy a Linux box

## Travel / Remote Work System
If you are going to be traveling a lot, then you will want a travel system. This can be a laptop, or it can be a tablet with a keyboard, or it can be a Chromebook. Basic coding doesn't require much compute power. However, since you want a computer that is powerful enough to run a virtual machine, you will want a computer with at least 16GB of RAM. Get the most RAM you can afford.
