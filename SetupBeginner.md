# Beginner Dev Setup

First piece of advice: pay attention to recommendations in the Intermediate and Advanced Setups if you want to think about building a system you can grow with. If there are two tools that do similar things, one is easier to use but more limited, the other takes more knowledge to use but is more powerful, I will recommend the easier one for beginners and the more powerful one for intermediate / advanced users. You might want to choose the more powerful option even as a beginner, so that you can grow with it and not have to switch tools.

## Computer Choice

Your best options are Mac or Linux. Microsoft is not a viable option, although if you must use Microsoft at work, then go ahead and learn it.

I personally use a Mac computer, because I think it is the best option for me (and for most developers). You can read my [rant](/MyDevSetup.md) to understand why.

Mac is the most powerful computer on the market, although at a steep price. It is also the most popular platform for development among professional programmers. Linux hardware is generally much cheaper than a Mac, and of course the software is free. Linux also is generally lightweight, so you can get great performance even on older computers.

If you go with Mac, the options are iMac, Mac Mini, Mac Studio, or Mac Pro. Buy whatever is in your budget, but know that the only one that is truly upgradable is the Mac Pro, and you will pay through the nose. Make sure you buy enough RAM up-front. With Mac, you are getting the best computer out there, but will pay a lot for it. If you are resource-constrained, either buy a Mac Mini with lots of RAM, or go with the Linux option below.

If you go with Linux, you can either build your own (recommended if you want to learn some hardware, and gain bragging points), buy a computer with Microsoft Windows on it and convert it to Linux, or buy a specialized Linux computer (Tux?) You will definitely get more bang for your buck with Linux compared to Mac. With enough time, energy, and tweaking, you can make Linux look and behave very well.

As for which Linux distribution to use, there are roughly three major groupings. The dozens of various distributions out there are generally derived from one of these three.
1. The popular choice is Ubuntu (most installations). It is generally easier for beginners, has lots of flavors, and is well-supported an stable.
2. The second choice is the Red Hat family, to include RH Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Fedora. These are very stable and supported distros, and generally are the best for enterprise use. If you will be ssh'ing into a server, it will probably be running RHEL or CentOS. I personally use Fedora for this reason, so that I am used to the particularities of this system.
3. The third choice is Arch (btw). Istalling Arch requires a lot more involvement, and is not for the faint-of-heart. What you get at the end is a highly-customized version of Linux, the use of the excellent Arch User Repository (AUR), and bragging rights.
4. Another consideration is that while Ubuntu and RH are well-supported, stable, and have multiple flavors for installation, they are also owned by companies (Canonical and Red Hat/IBM respectively). They could have telemetry installed (fancy word for spyware), and development is at the whims of the companies involved.

## Travel / Remote Work System
If you are going to be traveling a lot, then you will want a travel system. This can be a laptop, or it can be a tablet with a keyboard, or it can be a Chromebook. Basic coding doesn't require much compute power. However, since you want a computer that is powerful enough to run a virtual machine, you will want a computer with at least 16GB of RAM. Get the most RAM you can afford.
