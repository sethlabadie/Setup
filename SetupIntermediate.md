# Intermediate Dev Setup

## Computer Choice
MacBookPro

You can set your iCloud documents folder to be your default documents folder, so files can be accessed them from any computer that is set up similarly. This will also make it much easier if you are also using a Mac Book Pro for your travel system. Just save the file on your desktop computer, and open it on your Mac Book Pro. Automatically. No need to transfer files. There are three downsides to this approach. First, you will need to pay for more iCloud storage. Third, your computer startup time will be dramatically increased--perhaps a half hour or more. I don't know why this is, but I think it is because the computer is trying to sync all of your files. It is irritating. I just restart my computer before I go to bed, and it is ready in the morning.



## Desktop Setup
Mac Mini or Studio, or make your own Linux box
### Desk

I recommend getting a sit-stand desk. I don't have any specific brand recommendations yet. For a desk shelf, I have seen GroveMade advertised quite a bit, and it looks nice. GroveMade also makes a lot of other nice desktop components.

### eGPU
If I am using a Mac Book Pro, iMac, or Mac Mini in the future, I would like to get an external GPU (eGPU) to boost the graphics performance. I do Data Science work, so this will be helpful in doing machine learning. I will mount it underneath the desk.

I would also like to get a Thunderbolt dock to connect to multiple monitors and other peripherals. I am not currently using a computer dock since I don't have a laptop and I am not using multiple monitors, but I would choose one that has the power to connect to multiple monitors using Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt is better and faster than HDMI, and can send data both ways. I believe that the iVANKY FusionDock Max 1 Thunderbolt 4 is the best on the market. It has two Thunderbolt 4 connections for monitors, while the competition all have only one Thunderbolt 4 connection. The two connections allow for up to four 4k monitors at 60Mhz refresh rate. Many people also mention the CalDigit TS4 as a great option.

The iMac has a built-in monitor (which is of good quality), so I don't have a separate monitor. In the future I will get a widescreen monitor, with another monitor in landscape mode to display my email program, slack, or code.

For desktop speakers, I would like a set which uses s/pidf or optical audio. I don't have a recommendation yet, but the Klipsh R-41PM might work well. Kanto speakers also look nice, with a nice wood finish, but not all models have s/pidf or optical audio.

For a keyboard, I am using the MacTigr from Das Keyboards. It is a mechanical keyboard designed with a Mac layout. Das also offers Dvorak keycaps, if that is your typing orientation. The only gripe I have is that I wish this keyboard had backlighting. Other Das keyboards do have backlighting, but not the MacTigr. Finally, I pair this with the Palm Rest One, which I think is a necessity. I am considering exploring the Keychron line, and also ergonomic keyboards such as the MoErgo Glove80 and the Dactyl Manuform, but I haven't tried them yet.

For a mouse, I use the Logitech MX Master 3 for Mac mouse. It also needs a good mousepad. I prefer hard plastic. For this, I use the Logitech-G G440 Gaming Mousepad. Previously, I used the SteelSeries QCK Hard Pad, which was also really good. Both are about equal in my opinion.

For headphones, I use the Bose QuietComfort headphones (formerly QuietComfort 45), although Bose recently came out with the QuietComfort Ultra. I am intrigued by the Das Holosonic T1w headphones, which are much cheaper and also connect over wifi in addition to bluetooth.

I use a generic bookstand that I bought on Amazon. There are plenty of other options.

A light is important to illuminate your workspace. BenQ Blue Genie LED Desk Lamp is a good choice. Although it is offered still on Amazon, BenQ apparently doesn't make it anymore. BenQ also offers the e-Reading Desk Lamp and a monitor lightbar called the ScreenBar Halo, either which might be a good option.

For work, I need to insert a security card in order to access certain websites. For this, I use the Cherry SmartTerminal ST-1144. It has a hefty weight and sits nicely on my desktop. Another option might be the HID Omnikey 3121. Follow the advice here for USB and here for USB-C. Don't buy any cheap Chinese crap on Amazon, because you never know what malware it contains.

## Poetry
Really should be using a virtual environment. As a beginner, you weren't. That's ok, you were just learning. Now you are going to start using a virtual environment. Poetry is a package manager and virtual environment manager. It is a replacement for pip and virtualenv. It is a better way to manage your Python packages and virtual environments.
